=# Emertxe-IoT-Internship

## Overview

This repository contains the code and instructions for a home automation project developed during the Emertxe IoT Internship. The project involves automating garden lights, temperature conditioning, and serial tank operations using Arduino and PicsimLab.

## Tools Used

- **Arduino IDE**: IDE used to code the project.
- **PicsimLab Simulator**: Simulates Arduino Uno.
- **Blynk IoT Application**: For monitoring and controlling IoT devices.

## Getting Started

### Install the Required Tools

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Download and install [PicsimLab Simulator](https://picsimlab.sourceforge.net/).
3. Download the [Blynk IoT application](https://www.blynk.io/) on your mobile device.

### Setup the Project

1. Open the project files in the Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the IDE.
3. Simulate the project using PicsimLab to ensure everything works as expected.
4. Configure the Blynk app to connect with your project and monitor/control the devices.

### Usage

- **Garden Lights Automation**: Ensure the LDR sensor is properly connected. The lights will automatically turn on or off based on the light level detected.
- **Temperature Conditioner**: The temperature readings will be displayed on the Blynk dashboard.
- **Serial Tank Automation**: Use the set of instructions to manage the water tank operations.
