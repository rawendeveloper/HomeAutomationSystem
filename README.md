# 🏠 Home Automation System Project - Emertxe IoT Internship

## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains the code and instructions for a **Home Automation Project** developed during the **Emertxe IoT Internship**. The project focuses on automating garden lights, temperature control, and water tank operations using **Arduino** and **PicsimLab**.

The automation system integrates with the **Blynk IoT** platform, allowing users to monitor and control their IoT-enabled devices remotely via a mobile app. The project emphasizes energy efficiency, convenience, and easy-to-use remote monitoring.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install the Required Tools

- Download and install **Arduino IDE** from the official Arduino website.
- Download and install the **PicsimLab Simulator** to simulate Arduino Uno functionality.
- Download and set up the **Blynk IoT application** on your mobile device (available for Android and iOS).

### 2. Set Up the Project

- Open the project files in **Arduino IDE**.
- Connect your **Arduino Uno** to your computer and upload the code using the IDE.
- Use **PicsimLab Simulator** to simulate the project and ensure it operates as expected.
- Configure the **Blynk IoT App** by generating an authentication token and adding relevant widgets to control and monitor your devices remotely.

## 📋 Usage

### 1. **Garden Lights Automation**

- Connect an **LDR sensor** to the Arduino. The lights will automatically turn on or off based on the ambient light levels detected by the sensor.

### 2. **Temperature Control**

- The temperature data from a **temperature sensor** will be displayed on the **Blynk dashboard** in real time. You can also automate actions based on temperature thresholds.

### 3. **Water Tank Automation**

- Use the Arduino and relays to automate the water level control in a **serial tank**. The system will manage the filling and emptying operations based on predefined conditions.
